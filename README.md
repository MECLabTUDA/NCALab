# nca-models

Training code and pre-trained models for Neural Cellular Automata on different datasets and tasks.
Since NCAs are so small (less than 1 MB each), we include pre-trained weights for all tasks in this repo.


## Tasks and models included in this repo

  * Growing NCA for emoji generation
  * Self-classifying MNIST digits


## Future tasks

Tasks we want to include in the future:

  * 

Feel free to create an issue if there is a task you're interested in.
However, we will only provide weights for public data.
