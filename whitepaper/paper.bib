  abstract = {Despite considerable success, large Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) with UNet backbone pose practical challenges, particularly on limited hardware and in processing gigapixel images. To address these limitations, we introduce two Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)-based DDMs: Diff-NCA and FourierDiff-NCA. Capitalizing on the local communication capabilities of NCA, Diff-NCA significantly reduces the parameter counts of NCA-based DDMs. Integrating Fourier-based diffusion enables global communication early in the diffusion process. This feature is particularly valuable in synthesizing complex images with important global features, such as the CelebA dataset. We demonstrate that even a 331k parameter Diff-NCA can generate 512x512 pathology slices, while FourierDiff-NCA (1.1m parameters) reaches a three times lower FID score of 43.86, compared to the four times bigger UNet (3.94m parameters) with a score of 128.2. Additionally, FourierDiff-NCA can perform diverse tasks such as super-resolution, out-of-distribution image synthesis, and inpainting without explicit training.},

  abstract = {Traditional Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) with UNet backbones are over-parameterized, compromising their effectiveness on limited hardware and in processing gigapixel images. To address this inefficiency, we introduce two Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)-based DDMs: Diff-NCA and FourierDiff-NCA. Leveraging the efficient local communication of NCA, Diff-NCA drastically reduces parameter counts, effectively generating 512 {\texttimes} 512 pathology slices with just 336k parameters. Extending this approach, FourierDiff-NCA integrates Fourier-based diffusion to facilitate early global communication, essential for handling complex datasets such as CelebA. With only 1.1 m parameters, it achieves a more than two times lower FID score of 49.48 compared to the four times larger UNet, which scores 128.2. This performance disparity underscores the utility of NCA-based methods in enhancing parameter efficiency. FourierDiff-NCA also demonstrates versatility by performing tasks such as super-resolution, out-of-distribution image synthesis, and inpainting without task-specific training.},
