# Summary

Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are lightweight neural network models that can be employed in various image analysis tasks such as image segmentation, classification and generation.
Initially proposed in 2020 [@mordvintsev2020growingb], these models are recently getting attention thanks to their small size, their robustness and their overall versatility.
In terms of accuracy, they are often on-par with state-of-the art models for the respective downstream task, while being orders of magnitude smaller in size.
However, the training dynamics of NCAs are not yet fully understood, and there is potential for investigating practical tweaks to increase accuracy, reduce VRAM requirements and increase the overall training stability.
`NCALab` provides a unified and extensible research framework for training and evaluating NCAs, conducting structured hyperparameter searches and prototyping applications that use NCAs for image analysis.


# Statement of Need

Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are recently gaining attention especially in medical imaging, where they are deployed for various modalities in different downstream tasks, including 3D prostate segmentation on MRI [@kalkhof2023mednca] [@kalkhof2023m3dncaa], image registration [@ranem2024ncamorph] or image synthesis [@kalkhof2024frequencytime], [@kalkhof2025parameterefficient].
In most cases, they outperform other Convolutional Neural Network or Vision Transformer architectures in terms of _model size_ and robustness [@kalkhof2023mednca], while yielding similarly accurate predictions.
However, there is no _unified_ framework or reference implementation for training, evaluation and experimentation with NCAs.
Further, there are currently no set of best practices for designing NCA models with respect to their hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons, hidden channels or fire rate.

A systematic analysis is difficult, as the research code of NCA contributions is typically organized in individual repositories with different frameworks and coding styles for each downstream task under investigation.
Code bases often follow different approaches, even though the underlying architecture is in most parts universal -- in most cases, it can be defined by the number of input channels, hidden channels and output channels and the weights of the trained network.
Since there is currently no unified framework, deployment of NCA models in practical applications (or as part of other learning pipelines) remains difficult.

The goal of `NCALab` is to provide a uniform and easy-to-use code base for various downstream tasks with NCAs as a packaged Python module.
Within minutes, researchers and practitioners should be able to create prototypes for their ideas, inspired by the example tasks provided in this code repository.


# Features

`NCALab` provides dedicated models and example tasks for image analysis tasks, such as:

* Growing Neural Cellular Automata for emoji generation from a single pixel, akin to Mordvintsev et al. [@mordvintsev2020growingb].
* Self-classifying MNIST digits, similar to the work of Randazzo et al. [@randazzo2020selfclassifying].
* Pixel-wise medical image segmentation of Endoscopic images on the Kvasir-SEG [@jha2019kvasirseg] dataset.
* Multi-class medical image classification on subsets of the MedMNIST [@yang2023medmnist] image dataset.

Until now, NCALab provides the following key features:

* Simplified creation, loading and training of NCA models for various image analysis tasks
* Streamlined grid search for model and training hyperparameters
* Tensorboard integration to monitor training progress
* k-fold cross validation
* Control over various hyperparameters of NCAs
* Finetuning by re-training the final layer of an NCA
* Visualization and animation of the NCA inference process


# Ongoing Research

A conference paper utilizing `NCALab` was recently accepted for presentation in [IPCAI 2025](https://ipcai.org), and was published in the _International Journal of Computer-Assisted Radiology and Surgery_ [@krumb2025encapsulatea].
In this paper, `NCALab` is used to train models for image segmentation and monocular depth estimation.
The trained models are exported to C headers and ported to a microcontroller.


# Dependencies and Tooling

`NCALab` mostly builds on pytorch [@paszke2019pytorch], numpy [@harris2020array] and matplotlib [@hunter2007matplotlib].
Code quality is ensured by unit tests ([pytest](https://pytest.org)) and automated static code analysis through [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) and [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).
The project uses [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) for fast and simplified dependency management.
Code documentation is generated through [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) and is automatically uploaded to [readthedocs](https://ncalab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Releases of `NCALab` can be downloaded from the Python Package Index ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/ncalab/)).
