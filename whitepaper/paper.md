# Summary

Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a new family of neural network models that are employed in various imaging tasks such as image segmentation, classification and generation.
NCALab provides a generic research framework for training and evaluating NCAs, conducting hyper parameter searches and prototyping applications that build on NCAs.


# Statement of Need

NCAs are recently gaining attention in medical imaging, where they are deployed for various modalities in different downstream tasks.
In most cases, they outperform other U-Net or transformer-style architectures in terms of model size and robustness, while being on par with their accuracy.
However, there is no unified framework or reference implementation for training, evaluating and curiously experimenting with NCAs.

Research code for Neural Cellular Automata is typically organized in individual repositories for each individual research task.
Code bases follow different structures, even though the architecture is universal; in most cases, it can be defined by the number of input channels, hidden channels and output channels and the weights of the trained network.

The goal of this project is to unify the code base for many downstream task with NCAs in a shared project.
Within minutes, researchers and practitioners should be able to create a lean codebase for their task at hand, inspired by the numerous example tasks provided in the code repository.
