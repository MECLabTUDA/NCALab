Introduction to Neural Cellular Automata
=========================================

Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a new type of neural network models that merge the concepts
of Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Networks.
In particular, they operate on a cellular grid or graph, applying a learned transition function
in multiple time steps.

They were originally proposed in 2020 by Mordvintsev et al. in an online publication titled
`Growing Neural Cellular Automata <https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/>`__, which features an online demo
of a Lizard emoji that emerges from a single black pixel.

Recent work on NCA is displayed in a curated `Awesome List <https://github.com/MECLabTUDA/awesome-nca>`__.
